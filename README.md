a repository from a newb

As mentioned above, i'm new to this world (not the real world, the world of github and programming), and i hope to find the resources that will guide me through the path of knowledge.
This community seems to be the right place to start with the learning process.
I want to acquire a lot of skills and habilities for programming, all the knowledge about writting code i can get will be very helpfull to me
I will get skilled enough surely i will get a job programming.
